# Wifi Desk Light
# Work in Progress

## Project Idea
To create a ESP32 wifi controlled  NeoPixel. It will have a web interface to change the colours, patterns and brightness.

## Current State
The ESP32 hosts a basic html webpage that can turn on and off the neopixles. Currently this has used example code from the FastLED library and WIFI library.

## Next Steps
1. Find a way to host a more advanced website(such as React)
2. Create an interface to chance each ring of lights
3. 3d model and print the parts 
4. Add a capacitive touch button to turn on and off without wifi
5. Create a fritzing diagram 
6. Create a final parts list
7. Add a way to create light patterns  and favourites
